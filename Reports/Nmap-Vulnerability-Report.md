Target Information
Target Host: Metasploitable Lab Machine
IP Address: 10.10.10.10
Assessment Tool: Nmap 7.95
Executive Summary
A vulnerability assessment was conducted on the target system using network scanning techniques to identify exposed services, outdated software versions, and potential security risks.
The scan revealed multiple outdated services, insecure protocols, and critical exposures that could allow unauthorized access, data compromise, or full system takeover.
Overall Risk Level: Critical
Scope of Assessment
The assessment included:
•	Port scanning
•	Service enumeration
•	Version detection
•	Preliminary vulnerability identification
 No exploitation activities were performed.
Critical Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------	
1. FTP Server — vsFTPd 2.3.4 (Port 21)
Risk Level: Critical
This version is known to contain a backdoor vulnerability that could allow remote command execution.
Potential Impact:
•	Unauthorized remote shell access
•	Full system compromise
Recommendation:
•	Upgrade FTP software immediately
•	Disable anonymous access
•	Replace insecure services where possible

 
2. Root Bind Shell Exposure (Port 1524)
Risk Level: Critical
A root shell service is exposed directly to the network.
Potential Impact:
•	Immediate privileged access
•	Complete system compromise
Recommendation:
•	Disable this service immediately
•	Restrict network access
•	Monitor authentication logs
3. UnrealIRCd Backdoor (Port 6667)
Risk Level: Critical
Known backdoor vulnerability enabling remote command execution.
Recommendation:
•	Patch or remove the vulnerable service
•	Monitor for unauthorized access attempts


High-Risk Vulnerabilities
---------------------------------
Telnet Service (Port 23)
Telnet transmits credentials in plaintext.
Risks:
•	Credential interception
•	Session hijacking
Recommendation:
•	Replace Telnet with SSH
•	Disable insecure protocols
---------------------------------------
Samba Services (Ports 139, 445)
Outdated Samba versions may allow:
•	Remote exploits
•	Lateral movement
•	Credential harvesting
Recommendation:
•	Update Samba
•	Restrict access via firewall
Medium Risk Findings
------------------------------
VNC Remote Access (Port 5900)
Remote desktop exposure increases attack surface.
NFS File Sharing (Port 2049)
Potential unauthorized file access risk.
Recommendations:
•	Restrict access using firewalls
•	Implement authentication c
