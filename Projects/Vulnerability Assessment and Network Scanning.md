# Vulnerability Assessment & Network Scanning Project

## Objective
To identify security vulnerabilities within a target network by performing network scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability assessment to evaluate potential security risks.

## Tools Used
- Nmap (Port scanning & service detection)
- Nessus / OpenVAS (Vulnerability scanning)
- Linux Environment

## What I Did
Conducted network reconnaissance to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services. Performed vulnerability scanning to detect security weaknesses, outdated software, and possible misconfigurations. Analyzed scan results and documented potential security risks along with mitigation recommendations.

## Results
Successfully identified multiple open ports and services that could pose security risks if not properly secured. Highlighted vulnerabilities and suggested remediation steps such as patching systems, disabling unnecessary services, and strengthening access controls.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Vulnerability assessment methodology
- Network reconnaissance and enumeration
- Security risk analysis
- Report writing and documentation
- Understanding of common network vulnerabilities
