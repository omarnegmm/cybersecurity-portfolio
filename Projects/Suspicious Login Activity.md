# Incident Response Case Study – Suspicious Login Activity

## Objective
To simulate and analyze a potential security incident involving suspicious login attempts, investigate the activity, and demonstrate basic incident response procedures.

## Tools Used
- Wazuh SIEM / Log Monitoring Tool
- Linux Environment
- System Logs (Authentication Logs)

## What I Did
Simulated multiple failed login attempts to generate security alerts in a controlled lab environment. Monitored authentication logs using SIEM dashboards and analyzed event data to identify suspicious login patterns. Investigated the source of the activity and documented the incident response process.

## Results
Successfully detected unusual login behavior indicating possible brute-force activity. Identified the suspicious source, analyzed affected systems, and proposed mitigation steps including stronger authentication policies, monitoring improvements, and system hardening.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Security incident analysis
- Log monitoring and event correlation
- Basic incident response methodology
- Threat detection and investigation
- Security documentation and reporting
